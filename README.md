# Overview:

This personal project was exploring financial information obtained from a datset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirzahasnine/loan-data-set?resource=download&select=loan_train.csv).

# Objectives

This project will seek to answer three questions.

**Research Question 1:**
Is there a significant difference in the approval rates for loan applications based on gender and marital status?

**Research Question 2:**
Does gender influence the average loan amount granted to applicants?

**Research Question 3:**
How does the geographical location (Rural, Urban, or Semiurban) impact the likelihood of loan approval or denial?
   
# Methodology:

1. Preprocessing:

Obtained dataset comprising random loan applications, their outcomes, and applicant information, including gender, marital status, loan amount, credit history, income level, employment status, and geographical location.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   
Filtered the data to remove instances of where no information was provided or null values. Status was listed as 0 and 1 which was then changed to rejected and approved respectfully.

3. Data Analysis:
   
Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of loan approvals based on gender, marital status, and location. Used statistical measures to provide insight on comparisons. Explored regional variations in loan approval rates through visualizations and statistical analysis.
